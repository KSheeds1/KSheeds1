## Welcome! 👋

**KSheeds1/KSheeds1** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->
 My name is Katie and I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer, currently enrolled with Code Institute, Ireland.
 

- 🔭 I just finished working on [Gym Rat Dictionaries](https://github.com/KSheeds1/Gym-Rat-Dictionaries) a site I built using Flask, Python, and MongoDB. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Full Stack Frameworks, in particular Django and will be starting a new project called Boutique Ado to put
what I learn into practice!
